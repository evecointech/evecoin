# ELECTRIC VEHICLE ENERGY Coin - EVE Coin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin frameworks.  

*What is EVE COIN?*
Blockchain for 'Energy Internet". The project goal for Electric Energy Vehicle Coin - EVE COIN is to provide a Cryptocurrency representing Electric Vehicle Energy to pay for Electric Vehicle charging by electric vehicle owners.  The purpose is to build an advanced management framework for distributed energy resources to support scalable, fast, and secure peer-to-peer communications.

As the world moves away from fossil fuels and adopts Electric and alternative energy to power Vehicles, a cryptocurrency will be needed by consumers to pay for energy consumed at electric vehicle charging stations.

At present, it costs on average $.27 per kilowatt hour to charge electric vehicles in North America at consumer charge stations. The price/value for each EVE Coin would be based on that price as an energy derivative store of value.
